#Quotation marks in strings:
#When typing strings, there are single quotation marks ('') and double quotation marks ("")
#Either can be used to form a string, for example:
#print("Hello") or print('Hello) will run the same
#However, if you wish to use apostrophes or quotes inside a string, you will need to use separate quotation marks. For example:
#print("There's the man, over there!") is correct!
#print('There's the man, over there!') is incorrect! ('There's.. looks like you've ended the string after the word 'there' so the rest of what you type will display as an error!)
#Same goes for:
#print('The man said "There he is!"') is correct
#print("The man said "There he is!"") is incorrect ("The man said ".. looks like you've ended the string after the phrase "The man said " so the rest of what you type will display as an error!')
#In order to avoid this, we have back slashes (\)
#Back slashes allow us to proceed with writing out our string and indicates that the quotation marks that you're about to use shall be ignored and only used strictly as a string.
#The back slash will have to sit before the apostrophe itself. For example:
#print('There\'s a good chance this will still run as a string!')
#When using double quotations, you can still use a back slash method, it is trickier to use it when creating quotes inside another quote as it won't run as effectively as you'd like, for example:
#print("The man said \"There he is!"")
#See how it doesn't want to run as you are ending the quote with a full set of double quotation marks?
#print("The man said \"There he is!")
#Although this will run, it won't allow the end quotation mark to display, best stick to using opposite quotation marks in examples like these, such as:
#print('The man said "There he is!"')
#See how cleaner that looks? No back slash, no cut off quotation marks, no fuss!
